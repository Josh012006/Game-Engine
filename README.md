## Hi there
This is my first serious game project in SFML. It's a simple RPG game.
It is written solely in C++.

## It is not finished yet
I'm currently working on it and it's a great experience for me. For the moment, I've only really made
the splashstate and the main menu state.

Right now, I'm making the characters design:

**24/12/2024 : the front**

<img src="media/characters/mc.png" alt="The main character sprite">

**25/12/2024 : the back**

<img src="media/characters/mc1.png" alt="The main character sprite">

## Give it a try
You can see what I've already done by clicking on main.exe after the download and after you've unzipped the file. Have fun!!

To compile the code, you can run this command in the terminal:
-  **mingw32-make -f MakeFile** for Windows
-  **make -f MakeFile** in other OS

If it works without any error, you can then run **./main** in the Terminal to open the game. If the are any errors, feel free to
create an issue on the repository.
