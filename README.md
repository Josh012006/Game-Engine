## Hi there
This is my first serious game project in SFML. It's a simple RPG game.
It is written solely in C++.

## It is not finished yet
I'm currently working on it and it's a great experience for me.

## Usage
I'm currently coding it on Linux. So there are often problems when it is started on other OS.
BUt I will soon fix that issue.

## Give it a try
You can see what I've already done by clicking on main.exe after the download and after you've unzipped the file. Have fun!!

To compile the code, you can run this command in the terminal:
-  **mingw32-make -f MakeFile** for Windows
-  **make -f MakeFile** in other OS

If it works without any error, you can then run **./main** in the Terminal to open the game.
