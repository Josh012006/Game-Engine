## Hi there
This is my first serious game project in SFML. It's a simple RPG game.
It is written solely in C++.

## It is not finished yet
I'm currently working on it and it's a great experience for me.

## Give it a try
You can see what I've already done by clicking on main.exe after the download and after you've unzipped the file. Have fun!!
